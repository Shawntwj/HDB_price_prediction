in an HDB home, and that there are only about 284 HDB landed units, that makes this week’s home a really really rare one. Homeowners Grace and Wei Xiang (together with their dogs Truffle & Chanko) always knew that they wanted something different, and when they found this landed HDB home at Jalan Bahagia they knew that this was it. It’s a 2-storey landed unit, with about 1,000 square feet of built up space, and 1,400 square feet of land. 

They created a Japanese Zen garden in the front of their home by levelling out the whole porch, and it’s a really tranquil spot to sit and have a cup of tea. It’s certainly a really relaxing sight to see everything you get home.

There are 4 large bedrooms here, and it’s also a great option for entertaining as you have multiple dining places besides the main dining room. Another good thing is that the floor plate is split in half (like a dumbbell layout) so there is more privacy for the bedrooms as well.

The 5-room unit on paper was 1,216 square feet, but to them, it somehow felt smaller than their old 4-room flat.

This is our review of Lentor Modern, a 99-year leasehold new launch along Lentor Central.

Lentor Modern will likely be a game-changer to this area, breathing new life with a mall of its own and 25-storey towers that will soar above every building close by (for now, at least). It's also an integrated development with direct connectivity to Lentor MRT (TEL). Couple this with the lack of supply in the area, and the development seems to have all the ingredients of a hot new launch.

This week, we visit one of the most uniquely designed homes that was specially built for a family with two young daughters. Designed by Gwen Tan of Formwerkz Architects, it was conceptualised based on the brief from the family: the father wanted his daughters to experience the joy of running around freely as they were growing up. As such, the aptly named Ramp House was designed with ramps that wrap around the house that can take you from the garden on the ground floor to the rooftop 20-metre swimming pool.
