I've obtained my HLE, and after cooling measures, HDB did send a email saying that
""the maximum HDB housing loan amount that you are eligible for and indicated in the HLE letter remains the same, and no action is required from you if there has been no change in your financial circumstances.""

That's fine with me. There's a change in my financial circumstance (increase in salary beginning Jan 2022), but i don't think that will decrease my HDB housing loan so it doesn't really matter to me.

So let's say over the next few days, i manage to find a resale flat to my liking, and received an OTP and wish to exercise it immediately.

1) When will the housing grants be determined? I just received a substantial increment that would reduce my EHG. The increment will begin at January 2022, so if they base it on my past 3 months of salary, i assume I'd still get that pre-salary-increment EHG?

2) What's the timeline like for grants to be disbursed to your CPF? After submission of resale application? So after submission of resale application, once HDB approves, money goes into my CPF. During the first appointment with HDB, then i'll have to pay the transaction prices?

3) What about timeline for HDB loan to be disbursed?

Question on price/budgeting/loan.
4) Let's say the house cost 750k, valuation is 700k, which means there's a COV of 50k.
Is the following way of calculation correct?
750k house
- 50k to be paid in cash for COV
= 700k left
- 5k EHG grants
- 50k family grants (first time resale buyer)
- 20k proximity grant
= 625k remaining
- 90k CPF
= 535k
As valuation is 700k, maximum LTV for bank loan is 75% which translate to roughly 525k.
Meaning i can only take a bank loan of 525k and then I'll have to fork out another 10k in cash to pay off the house?

So in total, with a 750k house, 700k valuation.
I'd have to pay 60k in cash,
90k in CPF,
75k worth of grants,
525k obtained through HDB loan.

Correct?"

2. Grant will be disbursed (into your cpf) and deducted before anything else. Grant can only be use to paying downpayment and not stamp+legal fees. Take note there is a stamp fee of around $17k for a $750k unit .Can be paid by CPF or cash.

Thanks!

EHG of 15k, but after increment it will be 5k. But for prudence, i just assumed it'll be the lower amount for the calculation. But if it's based on average combined income of the past 12 months, this will probably include bonus which will reduce the EHG even further lol. I thought it was just simply based on gross income excluding bonus.

We still have a comfortable amount spare cash even after paying 60k in cash. It will be able to cover the stamp duties and legal fees and still have some spare cash left. There's still our stocks and bonds investments which we are hoping not to touch, but as a last resort, we're willing to liquidate some poorer performing ones.

Edited:
Ya there are much lower price HDB out there. But we're looking at houses built after 2005, and preferably after 2014~. Key consideration is that it must also be within 30mins journey from either of my/my wife's parent place (which naturally means within proximity radius also). So that limits down alot of houses. Tampines has a couple of newer 4room flats, but those are also like 610k~. The recent one we went to see, right opposite TP, the highest offer was already like 640k~. Chai Chee area houses are also >600k for a mid-floor house ):"

Deferred income assessment is for HDB loan eligibility just before you take keys. (which is 3 to 5yrs down the road)

Grant for BTO is always based on 12 month continuous employment prior to application online to get a ballot number for the bto. U already fail at this stage, so there is no more grant for u anymore."

- I am not staying together/near my parents/ married child/ single child aged 35 or above
- Other reasons

What's the underlined and bolded sentence sia.
Means I if I'm eligible, but choose not to take, I can purchase a resale flat today, not use proximity grant now.
When 5 years after MOP, I sell the resale flat, and purchase another resale flat near my parents, I can apply for Proximity Grant then (5 years later)? Because I didn't use that grant today.

What about selecting other reasons? Does it mean that if I choose other reasons, or i am not staying together/near/blah blah, means automatically I'll not be eligible for proximity grants in the future, even when i didn't take proximity grant today?

Ok saw Dollar&Sense article liao. If I don't take the Proximity Grant now, I can still take it next time. Proximity Grant can take once in total."

You are still definitely entitled to your share of the grant when u purchase an HDB. If both of you are getting a BTO, then your future wife who currently own an EC will need to dispose of her EC and wait 30 months before you can apply for BTO. For resale, the EC must be disposed off within 6 months from the resale completion."

For proximity grant, there is no income cap. Your parents will not be able to sell their flat away in the next 5 years. they are required to sign a declaration when you purchase your resale unit. So if they intend to sell it within the next 5 years, then not recommended for you to take the proximity grant."

Have you done your HLE, with the HLE, you will know what is the maximum amt of loan HDB will grant you and from there you can work backward.

In short, assuming the valuation is $700K as per what you think it is, You can use $700K - $80K CPFOA - $85K Grant = $535K (Estimated Loan Amt). If your HLE loan amount is less than this $535K, the shortfall will need to be paid in cash.

For HDB Loan, they usually will want to wipe out all your CPF first before determining the loan amount for you. You can have a choice to want to keep up to 20K in your OA.

Then for your cash component, it will be that COV of $40K (inclusive of the $5K option fee) + stamp duty $16,800 (can also use CPF if u want and have enough) +HDB admin fee and legal fee (less than 1K)"

Pls consider your age and your salary when you want to change strategy. In 5 years time, your salary might disqualified you from BTO or certain grants. Public housing policy might change looking at how chaotic current prices are going.

Me and my SO are in our late 20s. I honestly doubt we'll exceed the basic monthly combined income limit of 14k in the next 5 years.

There's this new BTO that's still undergoing construction at Area ""X"" (since 3 years back). My SO is still interested in that particular BTO, hence i came up with the idea of buying a resale flat for 5 years without any grant, then continue applying for better locations BTOs meanwhile, or buying the Area ""X"" freshly MOPed house after 5 years. This way, we'll still be considered first time applicants for BTO, and will still be eligible for any resale grants if we're getting resale flat after 5 years.

Not sure if that's possible though."

Not exceed $14k but might exceed $9k ? Grants will be much, much lower.

Late 20s and just starting a family is using involves future space concerns and schools considerations. Buying a 3-rm and waiting at least 6 years for that area X resale need a lot of planning. In fact, it will require all stars to be aligned !

Make sure of exit plan for the 3-rm, availability & suitability of area X in 6/7 years time, proper family planning, salary cap, etc."

Once buy resale flat, only can apply BTO after the 5yrs MOP of resale flat is over (no grant taken for current resale flat, also no diff to this rule. )

They already tweak this few yrs ago, so forget whatever you read which was written many years ago that say it is possible to apply BTO"

When filling up the BTO application form, there's a field to declare your occupation and another field to declare your monthly income.

I'm still a student, but I'm working full time and receiving CPF. In such scenario
- what should i declare as my occupation?
- if I declare as student, should I declare my income?

My thinking is it doesn't matter because they can verify from the cpf records anyway. Anyone have such experience and can share?

Resale HLE & CPF Grant 40K timeline

We are a Singaporean couple in the process of buying our HDB flat and we are close to (but below) the 14k combined income ceiling. We are expecting the HLE next week. My questions below:

1) I understand the CPF grant 40K be disbursed during the 10% downpayment stage later. Will there be another requirement to submit our recent income pay slips/bank account statements during the HDB loan release stage again?
2) The whole resale process takes 2-3 months. If our income increases and pushes us beyond our combined income ceiling beyond the 14k limit, what happens to our HLE and CPF grant?

Your replies would be highly appreciated.

Thanks for the reply vinz. If you take a look at the HDB first timer housing grants, it is stated that “If eligible, please download the relevant AHG application form or AHG/ SHG application form and submit it to us during your flat booking appointment.” So I wanted to try my luck to apply for AHG/SHG since I only need to submit the housing grants application form during flat booking appointment. Yes, I understand the chance is slim and I did not meet the “continuously employed for the 12 months prior to the flat application” and HDB has recently announced that the waiting time for balloting result will be shortened from 6 weeks to 3 weeks, which means I might not even meet the 12 months employment prior to flat booking appointment (provided my ballot is successful). Maybe I would like to ask what is the intent of meeting this requirement of “continuously employed for the 12 months prior to the flat application” in order to apply for housing grants? Rules are rules but they are always created for a reason.

For SC+PR applicant, do we qualify for the full EHG or the Non-Citizen Spouse scheme (half)? buying a brand new flat from HDB

Found this online looks like the full grant is available however need to add 10000 premium on top of it

First-Timer SC/PR Couple Buying a BTO
There are two grants of interest to you:

Enhanced CPF Housing Grant – gives you up to $80,000
Citizen Top-Up
Like the scenario of the SC/SC couple buying a BTO, the amount you’ll get depends on your income (capped at $9,000/mo).

Just note that you’ll have to pay a premium of $10,000 on top of the purchase price for that BTO flat. You’ll get it back later on, but only if the PR spouse converts to Singapore citizenship"

Resale HLE & CPF Grant 40K timeline

We are a Singaporean couple in the process of buying our HDB flat and we are close to (but below) the 14k combined income ceiling. We are expecting the HLE next week. My questions below:

1) I understand the CPF grant 40K be disbursed during the 10% downpayment stage later. Will there be another requirement to submit our recent income pay slips/bank account statements during the HDB loan release stage again?
2) The whole resale process takes 2-3 months. If our income increases and pushes us beyond our combined income ceiling beyond the 14k limit, what happens to our HLE and CPF grant?

Your replies would be highly appreciated.

Cheers."

1. For the EHG, when will the money be credited to your CPF OA account?
2. Can i use the grant that is credited to my OA account to pay for my initial down payment of my BTO?
3. i am in Uni now and my gf is currently working, however, i understand she has to be working consecutive 12 months, she worked 15 months already but in between she had a 1 month break to find a new job. Understand it is not considered 12 consecutive month like that. Any way to still get the grant? Or anyone tried appealing before? Hope someone can help

Hi,

When filling up the BTO application form, there's a field to declare your occupation and another field to declare your monthly income.

I'm still a student, but I'm working full time and receiving CPF. In such scenario
- what should i declare as my occupation?
- if I declare as student, should I declare my income?

My thinking is it doesn't matter because they can verify from the cpf records anyway. Anyone have such experience and can share?"

Hi @kkboy1,

The income assessed does not include bonuses or 13th month AWS.

Allowances on the other hand may be considered.

I quote from HDB:

“Income/ allowance that will be considered for the income ceiling
- Allowances (fixed/ variable) received on a regular basis, such as allowances for food, transport, laundry, uniform
- Sustenance Allowance
-Stipend

Income/ allowance that is not considered for the income ceiling
- Alimony allowance
- Bonuses
- Income from ad hoc overtime work
- Interest from deposit accounts
- National Service Allowance
- Pension
- Rental income
- Scholarship overseas allowance
- Overseas cost of living allowance
- Director’s fee”

Hope this clarifies."

My wife is a foreigner, so her income will not be taken into account in the HDB loan.

But her income will be taken into consideration for grants? Also, what if I as the Singapore citizen was not in continuous employment for the past 12 months but she is. Will we still qualify for AHG and SHG?

And also, if we apply with our Singaporean child, will we be eligible for the First Timer grants or is it still the Non-Citizen Spouse scheme?

Hi, I am unable to answer you with regard to your qn on grants. You will be eligible for the first timer grant if you apply with both your foreign wife and singaporean baby as you have formed a family nucleus hence it will not be under non-citizen spouse scheme.

Actually its 12 months prior to flat application (submit application online for BTO ballot, pay $10) , not flat booking (which i assume you meant the stage where u get to choose the unit of your choice)

From HDB website :
You and/ or your spouse/ fiancé(e) are employed at the time you submitted the flat application, and have been continuously employed for the 12 months prior to the flat application

For your case, you are obviously not eligible, so maybe you want to skip this BTO or skip this grant.

Pls click : First-Timer Applicants AHG / SHG

Take note, they are quite strict on this 12 months deadline and really want income payslip + cpf proof.
_________________________

From May 2018 onwards, they actually relax this rule for couples who are both studying or in NS etc.

From HDB website :
Both parties of a couple must: Be full-time students or National Servicemen (NSF); or
Have completed studies or National Service (NS) within the last 12 months prior to the flat application.

pls click : Deferred Income Assessment

Pls check which is relevant to you. The new rule (May 2018) should be the more applicable one.

Yes, I understand the chance is slim and I did not meet the “continuously employed for the 12 months prior to the flat application” and HDB has recently announced that the waiting time for balloting result will be shortened from 6 weeks to 3 weeks, which means I might not even meet the 12 months employment prior to flat booking appointment (provided my ballot is successful). Maybe I would like to ask what is the intent of meeting this requirement of “continuously employed for the 12 months prior to the flat application” in order to apply for housing grants?

My personal opinion :
HDB want to ensure the lower income group (thus eligible for this grant) are actually in some form of full time employment (12 months) before they attempt to ""BUY"" a bto. This at least make sure they are self sustaining themself ,and with HLE (maximum loan allowed) + some form of AHG SHG grant, they are able to proceed with the purchase, and most important able to pay off the monthly loan.

I would had think of the headaches HDB officer face when a owner default on payment due to lost of job etc . Imagine a part timer working every alternate month and expect a loan from HDB (and this AHG SHG too). Sooner or later problem will come for the owner and HDB also."

Hello Ecstatic,

Since the previous flats were under your mum's name, I believe that she will not qualify for any first time grants. However, if the incoming resale flat is under your name, you will need to fulfil some criteria in order to qualify for the grants. e.g at least of 35 years old.

If you fulfill all the requirements, i don’t see why hdb will not approve your AHG and SHG. Based on your income, your AHG should be 15k as you fall in the $3501 - $4000 bracket.

Criteria is very strict for AHG/SHG. 12 months full employment with PROOF. CPF statement is a must , with all 12 months proper payslip submitted.

Usually when talking about grant, we are talking about grant for first timer getting RESALE FLAT (not BTO). That is called the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant for First-timers.

Refer to the new grant amount Feb 20th : Enhanced CPF Housing Grant for First-timers

If BTO, buyer are only eligible for Additional housing grant (AHG) and Special Housing Grant (SHG), and not the first timer grant as above. Most BTO buyer who qualified for this two grant are of the lower income, and thus most of them wouldn't be buying a 5room BTO flat too."

I just want to check:

I had applied for AHG/SHG during my first appointment in Feb 2017 and submitted all the documents which we could get approx $60k of grants (AHG+SHG)

The grants are still processing and I am looking at job opportunities as I just graduated recently.

So my question is:

1. Will my grants be affected if I start to work now (because with my pay, our income ceiling would rise and grants would be lesser)?

2. The grants are based on the documents I submitted on the 1st appointment right?

3. Will there be any changes if there is a change in our income after the submission of the documents but before the approval of the grant?

4. How long does HDB take to process the grant because it had been a month and I have not receive any news from them.

Thank you so much in advance!"

Hi you're in luck as i'm self employed and employed at the same time. As for my case i applied for AHG & SHG grants under the Single Scheme.
When i went for my flat selection, i submitted my application for grants to the officer with documents only from my employed income of 12 months. I did not declare i was self employed at that time. A month later, they found out somehow and ask for additional documents to support my self employed income status with many documents. I followed the instructions submitting 2 to 3 times of docs and even went down to HDB to declare my self employment status. I must say it was because they had to do stringent checks on income etc.
Finally, after a good 3.5 months after my first appoinment i received my grants and afew days later the date for my 2nd appt.
HDB just want you to furnish and be accurate with your income declaration for them to give us the grants that's all. And so for your questions;

1. They will require NOA for past 2 years to do stringent checks what've you've declared for self employed status and just check what your self employed income earned for 12 months (they will let you know so be prepared for it);

2. And they will require the company payslips from the employed status or company you working for but please buffer in another 1 month (these payslips have to be 12/13 months before the flat application month) eg NOV 2016 BTO application then payslips must be from NOV 2015 to OCT/NOV 2016.

Nothing to worry about so much but i must say it's even more tedious if income status is both self employed and employed because HDB just want to make sure with the grants given out. Just be accurate as possible and they will surely give you the grants. Good luck!"

My PCD updates was End of July 2017. And I then start to submit the necessaries for HLE assessment in June. That was unsuccessful and I strongly think it was due so the 'messy' docs that I submitted because at that point of time my husband switched job. So his payslip records wasnt consistent for 2mths.

So fast forward cut story short. We were made to resubmit a whole new application. This is already Oct. And I am really really hoping for this round of hle to be approve.

Back to the PCD updates, cld it be because of my hle delay that it also affects my key collection appt? Cz its still showing 'End of July' and there wasnt any updates.

Secondly, I actually just found out recently abt the AHG & Special Grant schemes very very recently and after checking eligibility, both me and husband actually qualifies for it. Really I almost cried at how is it that the grant tingy did not come crossing my mind all this while. So during my signing of agreement back then in 2013, we didnt submit anything. We are currently waiting for our hle to be finalize. Is it too late for me to submit the application now? Im really worried if my loan will have shortfall. And after doing calculation, if I were to get the grant, everything will be covered liao and I dont hv to worry so much abt how much loan will I get out of hle.

I really really appreciate any reply. Cz I really need my keys soonest. So stressful!"

Just want to check if anyone encounter/knowledge for resale flat on PHG - proximity housing grant.

Firstly, to be eligible

Your parents/ married child are:

1. living with you in the resale flat
2. living in an HDB flat in the same town or within 2km
3. owner-occupants of private property in the same town or within 2 km

If the resale flat, I'm looking for is slightly more than 2 km away (let's say 2.2 km) from my parent place. Have anyone appeal and manage to get the grant?

Thank you guys"

Then the seller say maybe, just maybe if you are lucky, later late evening will have mao shan wang coming in.

U thinking maybe give up the existing durian on table and just wait for another batch with ""0% Guarantee"" of even a good queue number, or a chance to chose a choice unit etc.

Does hdb allow you to bid again for another bto/sobf while holding a queue number to an existing bto?

I hope not, as basically if u are given yet again a good queue number, u be one of those who keep bidding but give up a unit when a better choice comes along.

If for example (just for discussion purpose), January 2017 there is another BTO right next to sembawang mrt, will u give up the sobf good queue number and try for this better location unit again?

Do note there are tons of people aiming for sobf, assume a bad case scenario u left with 2nd floor units only, u ok with it?
Worse case scenario u don't even have a queue number.

Do note many sobf are those bto which maybe completed in a few years time and not really 100% are those which u can immediately take keys and shift in.

Do work out the pro and cons yourself.

Our view are strictly from our own experience and expectation. Yours will be totally different from any of us.

I am writing just to let u look at the bigger picture.

Good luck.

They will only deduct what is necessary for the downpayment which in your case for bank loan, would be 5% Cash and 15% CPF..

So any remaining grant after deducting that 15% CPF portion would be left inside ur O/A..

Wipe will only happen during key collection.."

CPF Family Grant is $30k(But you will only receive $20k since she is PR then deduct 10k first, when she converts to citizen or when u have a citizen child then can apply for Citizen Topup to be reimburse back into your CPF).

You must first qualify for the above before the below can be done.

CPF Housing Grant(AHG) for resale based on ur income is $25k

Have to see if your spouse if she stop working 1 year before u buy the resale or what..Cos if within 1 year then whatever income she has would be average over 12 months and then taken into the calculation for grants along with your salary.

If applying for a resale near ur parents then can get Proximity Grant also of $20k.

Hi all,

Can someone shed some light on the pros/cons of utilising hdb first timer grant for resale flat ?

Thanks.

Depends. My sis who is single bought a resale with $11k grant in the face of rising prices. Within a month the grant was increased to $15k and she missed it due to cut-off date.

2 years later HDB allowed single to buy BTO and she is not eligible because she took the grant. Willing to return HDB the grant, also cannot."

You dont have to inform them to do this.

For anyone taking HDB loan, HDB will auto wipe out all your CPF ordinary account + any CPF grant to $0.00.

Not sure exactly for bank loan for BTO, but I took bank loan for EC and I could state exactly how much CPF I want to use.

I think for HDB loans, CPF OA is always wiped out to reduce the loan. Can't see why you would be prevented in any circumstance from using all your CPF OA monies if you choose to do so, for a bank loan."

Take note of this fact.

HDB want you to take the least amount of loan, thus they wipe out till $0 and you have the smallest amount to loan from them. Most people will just be needing loan of around 50-70% after this deduction.

Bank want you to take the max amount of loan, thus they let you chose how much you want to use from your CPF (subjected to the requirement that minimum 20% of valuation must be paid + stamp fees etc) , you can loan maximum up to 80% of the valuation price. The more you loan, the more interests you pay them at the end of the day.

And bank usually will entertain minimum loan amount of 100k upwards,
anything below this amount is basically not cost effective for them to do the deal with a purchaser.

Eg. Valuation 300k. You have 250k cpf which you want to use up, and keen to just loan 50k from bank.
Bank usually will reject your loan and ask you to look for other banks.

Thus some buyer got no choice but to loan around 100k from bank even if they can pay up more upfront.

No bank is obliged to take up your business and its usually up to their own discretion.

Good luck."

I think the website meant ""average household income over 12 months"" rather than ""average household income"" and the link you've given and the table you referred to has this clause at the end ""* All working persons’ (i.e. applicants and occupiers) income are included"" so it considers all forms of income, taking an average over 12 months (in case of raise, pay grade changes), for both of you imo."

It is combined average monthly income over a period of 1 year and not divided by 2 a month..

Let me give u an example,

A works for past 12 months prior to application and draws a monthly income of $2700.

B only work for 6 months during that period and drawing a monthly income of $3000.

They will qualify for grants as A has met the 12 months requirement.

So for calculation,

A = $2700 x 12 = $32400
B = $3000 x 6 = $18000
$32400 + $18000 = $50400 / 12 = $4200 average monthly combined income.

This would be use to place them into the range."

Refer to your query, kindly see the information that I get reply from HDB:

To buy a flat from the HDB, both of you must meet all the eligibility conditions including age, citizenship, average gross monthly household income ceiling of $12,000, etc. You may wish to visit our HDB InfoWEB to read all the eligibility conditions to buy a flat from the HDB or make use of our Eligibility Check for purchase of new or resale HDB flat eService to check if both of you can meet all the eligibility conditions.

Please note that if you are a Singapore Citizen (SC), your husband is a Singapore Permanent Resident and both of you do not have any children who are Singapore Citizens, your household will be considered an SC/SPR household and you will have to pay $10,000 premium which is added to the purchase price of the new flat.

If your husband obtains Singapore Citizenship or both of you have an SC child after collecting keys to the flat, you may apply for the Citizen Top-Up Grant of $10,000. Please visit our HDB InfoWEB for more information on the Citizen Top-Up Grant.

If both of you are first-timers, you may wish to note that to apply for the Additional Housing Grant (AHG) and/or the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG), at least one of the applicants (you or your fiancé) must have been working continuously for the past 12 months (backdated from the date that you applied for the new HDB flat) and your average gross monthly household income for the past 12 months must not exceed $5,000 and $8,500 respectively. Please visit HDB InfoWEB for information on the AHG and SHG eligibility conditions.

If you are applying for a flat to stay near your parents' house, you may apply for the Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) if their current residence is in the same estate or within two kilometers from the new flat that you are applying for.

Hello everyone,

My girlfriend and I are first timers in applying for HDB. My income is $2650 while hers is $2700.

Based on the link here: http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/first-timer-applicants

I believe our average monthly household income should be calculated as such:

(2650+2700)/2=2675

This should place us in the 2500-3000 Average Monthly Household Income bracket which will allow us to receive $25 000.

However, I was shocked when HDB places us in the 4000 Average Monthly Household Income. when asked, HDB states that they calculate the AHG grant by looking at our combined income

I would like to ask forumers here if this is true? As the phrasing Average monthly household income does not suggest that the AHG is calculated by looking at combined incomes. The website also do not contain any examples to show how AHG is calculated.

Let's say I'm eligible for the following grants as per HDB's terms and conditions.

• Additional CPF Housing Grant (Singles) S$20,000
• Special CPF Housing Grant (Singles) S$10,000

I'll not be taking any HDB or Bank Loan for my BTO 2 Room Flat. I know I can use cold hard cash to pay for downpayment (10%) during Signing Sales Agreement and balance payment (90%) during Collection of keys. I'll use cash to pay for Stamp duty and Legal fees as well.

Will HDB allow me not to exercise the usage of the grants and be kept in my CPF Ordinary Account along with my existing CPF funds?

My logic is I do not wish to pay the accrued compounded interest (doesn't make sense) to my own CPF Account should I need to sell the flat in the future.

Use of Grant

The AHG can only be used as capital payment towards the purchase of the new flat or to reduce the mortgage loan. You can use the grant to make the initial payment towards the purchase. The balance, if any, must be used to reduce the mortgage loan before a housing loan from the HDB is granted.

Benefits of AHG
AHG helps to reduce the loan required
No need to use cash to pay the monthly instalment

If you are buying the flat with a bank loan, the AHG will be treated as part of your CPF money. It can only be used to pay the CPF portion of the initial payment towards the purchase of the flat or to reduce the mortgage loan. It will be included in the computation of the CPF withdrawal limit. The Grant cannot be used to pay the monthly instalments.

Their decision is usually as it is. If they mention backdated to a certain launch(for example revised shg announced in aug 2013 and backdated to July 2013), they will strictly follow that.

Since they mention the latest changes to start from nov launch, it is as it is..so any application before start launch can just actually forget about the grant.."

My question is, does the 1 year needs to be the period of 1 year before date of selection or can it be any period as long as me/her worked for 1 year? So if it is the initial then will we be able to apply for AHG still? Because I personally quit my job which lasted for 8 months and started on my current business.

Hi there,

This reply might have been too late.

On AHG, either you or your partner must be (1) employed at the time of applying AND have worked continuously for 12 months to qualify. For (1) Though yr partner is unemployed (hope she has found a job), you have a part-time and must be able to prove it through payslips. For (2), that's the grey area, in the last 5 yrs, you have worked for continuous of 12 months, but that's in the past. Not sure if they'll accept.

On BTO, you guys should qualify as long as you don't exceed the $10k income ceiling.

Let us know if you had chosen your flat"

Hi,

I assume your foreign wife is not a PR. If that's the case, there is no grant available.
However if your wife is a PR OR you guys have a Singaporean kid. These grants would apply.

1. CPF Housing Grant for Family - $30k or $40k if living near parents
2. Additional CPF Housing Grant - $30k (with a monthly income of $2,500)

HDB states that the main applicant (you) must be Singaporean and the family nucleus (you and wife / kid) must have another PR or Singaporean to qualify for grants."

I need to enquire whether both of us is eligible for AHG and approximately what amount

you're eligible for AHG if combined monthly income is less than 5K.
about the amount, it's based on average combined income for the last 1 year.
If you apply 9 months later (your wife would have 1 year salary full, then ur average combined income would be 3.8K ==> AHG is 15K
but if ur application is now, then ur average combined income would be 2450 (based on your 1 year salary and your wife's salary for 3 months, and hopefully my calculation is correct) ==> AHG is 30K.

3. depends on price of your flat, amount of loan u intend to take, your CPF ordinary account, AHG amount. for rough breakdown of the cash you need to top up, you can use this HDB Sales Financial Plan

Currently they have their own HDB of course. Private property can have just one essential occupier? So I'm thinking if my gf gets named as the second essential occupier she will be utilising her first time status right? Then if were to get married and apply for BTO in future, under the cooling measure, does she has to sell off the condo within 6 months?"

im not sure about condo requirement, but once your gf use her name as condo owner, she cant apply for hdb anymore. even after she sell the condo, she need to wait for 30 months before she is eligible to apply for hdb again.

so, in order to buy the condo, if it's possible to just put her parents' name only, then die die don't put her name there."

IMHO, pls just apply for any grant scheme available if you think your income fit. Just filling some forms only. You have the chance to get some of them.

Anyway I do regret taking grants. The grants are in your CPF a/c before HDB deduct it for the purchase, so when you sell your flat, you still need to pay back the accrued interests on the grants portion as well. I am ok with paying accrued interests for the portion taken from my own CPF but a grant from the govt and I have to pay interest on it?? A grant(nice word) or loan, you decide."

Hi Lucas,

If you apply for BTO, you can only apply for AHG - additional housing grant. To get this grant, one of you must have worked for 1 year and your combined monthly household income must be below $5k.

BTO applicants do not get to enjoy the $30k-$40k CPF Housing Grant since the BTO is already discounted by approx. this amount - sometimes its more than this amount. (really depends on the area you are buying)"

very likely cash since your CPF is supposed to be your retirement funds in the future thus CPF will not allow you to use it to pay penalties such as this.
Please note you must repay the AHG with interest as well. (i think interest is 4% - set at special account rate)"

hi there, i have a qns similiar to the scenario you mentioned.

okay here goes. my gf is currently working for more than 1 year already and is drawing an income of est 2k~, but i'm still studying now. Can we apply for BTO even though we cant get the loan now? FYI, I should be graduating in exactly a year time.

Some other information on me. As i'm a part time student in SIM, I've been taking up temps and contract jobs on a regular basis. However, my current temp job do not contribute to CPF, and i've working on this ""no cpf"" job for like 6mths already. In addition, i just quit the job bcos i wanted to concentrate for the up coming exam.

My last CPF contribution comes from another company that i was employed as a perm. However, my stint there was short, lasted only close to 3 mths. Hence, the last CPF contributed was at least 6mths ago.

can i declare myself as unemployed? another qns is, when will our income be assess when applying for the HLE? as for now, i'm certain we can never succeed.

- Joint Applicants (husband & wife) Half of the full grant each.""

Kudos to the compilation done by the few kind souls.

Thumbs down to typical sinkaporean who basically just love to complain and not give compliment."

to be eligible for AHG, You or your co-applicant(s) must be in continuous employment for one year before the flat application.

Under ''Ëmployment Status''

Also, u need to be in your current job for at least 3 months to be granted a HLE.

if its not fair to you, how about those in their 30s with children trying to start a family and they have to compete with young people like you without income or job

circumstances is as follows:

we qualify for AHG, my girl has been working for 2 years now.
as for me, I'm just graduating from university and thus declared myself as student/unemployed.

for whatever reason, there's a meagre amount of $200+ in my CPF coming from my industrial attachment (compulsory internship) in Jan 2010 ending in Aug 2010. The preceding HDB officer then asked for documentation regarding the CPF contribution etc (which I didn't keep record of, the pitiful sum that it is).

Well, the thing is, by including any meagre amount of ""allowance"" as gross salary, the combined average monthly income will exceed $4000 surely.

My question:
Does HDB care what sort of employment is it? Any differentiating factor between ""allowance"" and ""salary""? If no, and HDB does include my meagre intern pay into the overall gross income, is there anyway to circumvent this, eg, talk to MP? The $5000 difference between $10000 and $15000 is a huge amount that can be used to offset the first 5% downpayment, as I'm currently in the phase of graduating and finding a job, which i have not, is substantial!

In your case, the consideration period for your AHG application is between March 2010 to February 2011?

I am quite certain the allowance will be included in the consideration as there are records of CPF contribution during your internship period. My only advice is to call up the officer handling your application to clarify this before deciding on any other action.

If it's AHG for hdb flat, whether resale or BTO, then you combined salary must be below $5k.r

Revised

For resale applications received on or after 5 March 2010, the MOP is 3 years from effective date of resale, regardless of the type of loan taken by the owners or loan status. Existing flat owners of non-subsidised flats will not be affected, i.e. the original MOP of 2.5 or 1 year continues to apply to them."

It's called CPF housing grant.

In the first place, CPF board will put the amount of grant you eligible for into your CPF ordinary account, and then HDB board will do the deduction (wipe out your ordinary to $0 if taking HDB loan) when you buy the resale flat.

When you sell, this grant amount will be return back into your CPF ordinary account, for you to keep or use for the next house etc.

HDB or CPF board won't ever ask you to return this grant in the form of CPF/CASH when you sell."

there isn't any rule stated that you have to work continuously 1 year in order to apply for a BTO flat.
The only thing that affects is that if you are elligible for AHG, u have to produce your past 1 year CPF statements. Part-time employment is put into consideration as well.
For my case, bf and i working continuously for 2 years. he full time i part time. we still got the flat and grant though"

Your first appointment alone can take up to 3 months. It depends on both you and seller. So I think sep should be pretty safe. For the grant i think it also depends on other factors like your income etc. You may want to check further in hdb website."

JUST UPDATED WITH THE NEW HDB URL LINKS:

Please note that there are basically 3 things which you have to take note if you are getting a brand new flat or a resale flat.

1) HDB loan - Can be use for Brand new and Resale flat (if buyer is eligible) , the most important criteria is that combined monthly income must not be more than $8k

Please click :



2) - (Brand new flat buyers can stop enquiring about this). The most important criteria is that combined monthly income must not be more than $8k.

The so called ""cheaper prices than market resale flats"" is the subsidy which HDB is giving to all brand new flat buyer..

Please click :



3) - (if buyer is eligible) , the most important criteria is that combined monthly income must not be more than $5k for the past 1yr.

Please click :






1) Buy brand new, get HDB loan, (if income more than 5k, but less than 8k) (5yrs MOP)

2) Buy brand new, get HDB loan, get AHG (if income less than 5k) (5yrs MOP)

3) Buy resale flat, get HDB loan, get 1st timer grant (if income more than 5k, but less than 8k) (5yrs MOP)

4) Buy resale flat, get HDB loan, get 1st timer grant, get AHG (if income less than 5k) (5yrs MOP)

5) Buy resale flat, get HDB loan , never apply for 1st timer grant, never apply for AHG (3yrs MOP)

if you are eligible for 300k loan, and you can get 50k grant, meaning you can afford to buy a 350k flat, should be no.2 of your ans

the CPF housing grant could be use for the initial 10% payment and if there's left over it will be used to deduct the remaining value of the flat, the grant cannot be use for the amount of cash-over-valuation, that COV must use cash...so if you can better buy resale flat at its valuation price

if the grant is not enuff for the initial payment you can use you CPF to top up the rest, if cpf also not enuff den you can use cash.

anyway the grant will be utilized fully for the initial payment or deducting the remaining value of the flat after the 10% initial payment, by right you should not have any grant leftover

just a little comment , do dump your cash into your flat only if you have no other investment vehicles available.

e.g. , if you have something that can get you 4 % interest per annum , that financial instrument would benefit you more ( 4 % per annum earned from it instead of saving interest of 2.5 % per annum or whatever is the cpf loan rate + 0.1 % )

if you have no interest or time to invest in anything else , then dump it all except for some backup savings to finish servicing your loan as a penny saved is a penny earned"

Its either you take (a) or (b).
Not both.

The AHG can be used for the purchase of new, resale and DBSS flats. It is an additional subsidy over and above the regular market subsidy and CPF Housing Grant that new and resale flat buyers enjoy respectively. The scheme was enhanced in August 2007, with the income ceiling and the grant amount raised - to help more households own their first flat.

On 6 February 2009, the AHG Scheme was further enhanced, to make owning an HDB home easier for more citizen households - especially the lower-income families.


The enhancements are as follows:
• Maximum AHG amount is increased from $30,000 to $40,000• Income ceiling is raised from $4,000 to $5,000
• Continuous working period preceding the flat application is reduced from two years to one year"

both ""1st timer"" grant & AHG are cpf grants. a resale flat buyer that eligible for AHG, would had applied ""1st timer"" grant before thinking of applying AHG. it shouldn't be treated as a different issue.

I got a question regarding grants:

Is the grant used to reduce your CPF loan ONLY or reduce the total amount needed to buy a flat?

1) For example.. If I'm ELIGIBLE for 300K loan, and 50K grants, Does it mean that HDB cut off 50K from the loan amount (meaning 250K loan) and I pay cash for the rest?

OR

2) The grant amount (50K) is deducted off the total sale price of the flat and you can still take up 300K loan.

Another way of understanding my question is:
If the flat costs 400K, Can I use 50K cash, 50K grant and 300K loan?
Or will HDB force me to use the grant as part o the loan, ie. 100K cash and 250K loan (50K granted)?

I hope ya guys understand ma question.. cheers.
Click to expand...
1st, the grant is either 30k 1st timer OR 40k 1st timer near parent. (where did your 50k come from? AHG?)
_____________________________

Assume 40k grant.

House cost 400k (assume valuation is 400k for resale flat),
Loan amount = 400k - 40k = 360k

If you want to pay another 50k using cash,
Loan amount = 400k - 40k - 50k cash = 290k

No need to come up with cash, the 360k (or 290k) is your loan amount (assuming you are eligible for this amount). Above is simple calculation, didn't add on the stamp fees, legal fees, insurance etc.
______________________________

Pls note the grant is always use to deduct from the valuation price (resale flat) and not the COV.
Any COV (resale flat) must be payable using cash from your own pocket."

i started work in Aug 08 as a temp staff getting ard 1.2k/mth for 3 mths. Next i drew 2.6k/mth for 6 mths and currently getting 2.8k.

1) Do they consider me as being 'continuously employed for one year'? am i eligible to apply for a flat (BTO)?

2) Also, my gf is currently still studying. Hence is my average household income {(1200 x 3)+(2600 x 6)+(2800 x 3)} / 12 which is equal to 2300? i understand that my current salary will allow me a $25k AHG. if they calculate my average annual income as above, my monthly salary will be 2300 which allows me to get $30k of grant?

3) Anyone can shed some light on the payment timeline of getting a HDB flat? downpayment 10% is after booking of flat which is shortly after application rite? is there any other cash outlays and approximate time period to the payments?

4) Say the BTO takes 5 years to complete. At which point of time will they assess me on the mortgage available for me to loan? will mortgage installments will start to kick in after you get the flat (eg:5yrs later?) This is cos im afraid that they will not loan too much to me if they assess me at point of application (since my gf is still studying). After my gf grads and both of us having worked for 5yrs, im quite confident we can afford a much larger mortgage loan.

1) HDB loan - Can be use for Brand new and Resale flat (if buyer is eligible) , the most important criteria is that combined monthly income must not be more than $12k

Please click : HDB loan eligibility check

2) Find out the grant you are eligible for as first timer.

Pls click : CPF Housing Grants for Resale Flats

Additional grant for staying near parents : Proximity grant

Most buyers will fit under one of the below:

1) Buy brand new, get HDB loan, (if combined family income less than 12k)

2) Buy brand new, get HDB loan, get AHG (if income less than 5k)

3) Buy resale flat, get HDB loan, get 1st timer grant (if income more than 5k, but less than 12k)

4) Buy resale flat, get HDB loan, get 1st timer grant, get AHG (if income less than 5k)

in order to resale a flat in open market, the owner must have occupied for at least 5yrs.

if less den 5 yrs and owner die die wanna get rid of it, hdb is the only choice he could opt for. But as you may note the remark from HDB, the repurchased flat could have been occupied previously or could be empty till now from the commencement of the lease date. i believe you could check it out from the neighbours of the unit you aiming. haha

btw those repurchase flat you cant get cpf grant except AHG, you can try to compare the pricing from the half yearly sale of those repurchase flats after deducting AHG and those resale in the open market after deducting AHG + CPF housing grant for first timer applicant."

Is the grant used to reduce your CPF loan ONLY or reduce the total amount needed to buy a flat?

1) For example.. If I'm ELIGIBLE for 300K loan, and 50K grants, Does it mean that HDB cut off 50K from the loan amount (meaning 250K loan) and I pay cash for the rest?

OR

2) The grant amount (50K) is deducted off the total sale price of the flat and you can still take up 300K loan.

Another way of understanding my question is:
If the flat costs 400K, Can I use 50K cash, 50K grant and 300K loan?
Or will HDB force me to use the grant as part o the loan, ie. 100K cash and 250K loan (50K granted)?

I hope ya guys understand ma question.. cheers."

if you are eligible for 300k loan, and you can get 50k grant, meaning you can afford to buy a 350k flat, should be no.2 of your ans

the CPF housing grant could be use for the initial 10% payment and if there's left over it will be used to deduct the remaining value of the flat, the grant cannot be use for the amount of cash-over-valuation, that COV must use cash...so if you can better buy resale flat at its valuation price

if the grant is not enuff for the initial payment you can use you CPF to top up the rest, if cpf also not enuff den you can use cash.

anyway the grant will be utilized fully for the initial payment or deducting the remaining value of the flat after the 10% initial payment, by right you should not have any grant leftover

if you had alot of cash, you can jolly well use it to buy your flat so you can loan minimum sum from HDB and mthly installment should try to be within your CPF mthly contribution"
