       "'Welcome to the first BTO guide of the year – our February 2022 BTO Launch Guide to help you choose the most suitable unit. This time around is slightly smaller than the November 2021 BTO launch, there will be 3,953 units across 4 estates on offer including the second Prime Location Public Housing Model (PLH). These are spread across 6 projects in Tengah, Yishun, Geylang and Kallang/Whampoa.\\n\\nIf you have set your sights this time, you’d probably need no introduction on the new PLH model, but just to recap:\\n\\nThe PLH model will impose additional restrictions, on HDB flats bought in prime areas:\\n\\n– 10-year MOP instead of five years\\n\\n– No renting out the whole flat\\n\\n– Subsidy Recovery, on top of existing resale levy\\n\\n– Tighter eligibility requirements\\n\\n– Reduced number of flats set aside for MCPS\\n\\nOur review is broken down by the 6 BTO sites on offer, starting with the mature estates. We share an overview of the project, the best stacks (in our opinion) as well as the pros and cons of the site and unit layouts on offer.\\n\\nThis has always been hotly anticipated, so here’s our comprehensive review of the February 2022 BTO launch!\\n\\nMature Estate\\n\\nDakota Crest (Geylang)\\n\\nProject Overview\\n\\nlocated along Geylang River and the Geylang Park Connector. It is bounded by Old Airport Road, Jalan Enam, and Dakota Crescent. This development comprises 3 residential blocks ranging from 17 to 22 storeys. You can choose from 443 units of 2-room Flexi, 3-, and 4-room flats.\\n\\nDakota Crest’s design is inspired by the blocks previously located at Dakota Crescent, paying homage to the previous estate through the use of motifs, colours, and detailing in its facade and facilities. Facilities at Dakota Crest include a residents’ network centre, a childcare centre, children’s playgrounds, as well as adult and elderly fitness stations, some of which are set against the backdrop of Geylang River. The development will also come with a precinct pavilion and three roof gardens located on top of the Multi-Storey Car Park (MSCP) and two of the residential blocks.\\n\\nDetails Info Town Geylang Est. Completion Date 4Q2027 Est. Waiting Time 63 months Remaining Lease 99 years Selection Period April 2022 to December 2022\\n\\nFlat Type Number of Flats 2-Room Flexi (Type 1) 40 2-Room Flexi (Type 2) 81 3-Room 80 4-Room 242 Total 443\\n\\nEco-Friendly Features\\n\\nTo encourage green and sustainable living, Dakota Crest will have several eco-friendly features such as:\\n\\nSeparate chutes for recyclable waste\\n\\nRegenerative lifts to reduce energy consumption\\n\\nBicycle stands to encourage cycling as an environmentally-friendly form of transport\\n\\nParking spaces to facilitate future provision of electrical vehicle charging stations\\n\\nUse of sustainable products in the development\\n\\nActive, Beautiful, Clean Waters design features to clean rainwater and beautify the landscapes\\n\\nSmart Solutions\\n\\nDakota Crest will come with the following smart solutions to reduce energy usage, and contribute to a more sustainable and safer living environment:\\n\\nSmart-enabled homes with provisions to support easy installation of smart systems\\n\\nSmart Lighting in common areas to reduce energy usage\\n\\nOverall Pros vs. Cons\\n\\nPros Cons Right across Old Airport Road for food options and basic amenities. Somewhat crowded area, close to heavy traffic Close proximity to City Centre. For families looking for bigger space, there is a lack of 5-room units.
