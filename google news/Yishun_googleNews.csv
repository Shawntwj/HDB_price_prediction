BoxFan in Yishun

Besides our Northpoint City Food Guide, there are plenty of eateries located around Yishun. Located in The Brooks I Condominium, which is in the Springleaf neighbourhood, near Nee Soon, BoxFan is a relatively new eatery that offers affordable DIY grain bowls, as well as bubble teas that are made by an ex-mixologist!

The team behind BoxFan comprises two chefs whose experience include stints at the now-defunct White Rabbit, restaurants in Mandarin Oriental and Raffles Hotel, and a husband-and-wife duo. Of this couple, the husband used to make cocktails at Ce La Vi‚îÅthe rooftop bar at Marina Bay Sands.

The rainwater collected can be used to wash common areas and water plants in the estates, among other non-potable uses.
