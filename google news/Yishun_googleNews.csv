BoxFan in Yishun



Image credit: @cliffton_jt

Besides our Northpoint City Food Guide, there are plenty of eateries located around Yishun. Located in The Brooks I Condominium, which is in the Springleaf neighbourhood, near Nee Soon, BoxFan is a relatively new eatery that offers affordable DIY grain bowls, as well as bubble teas that are made by an ex-mixologist!

The team behind BoxFan comprises two chefs whose experience include stints at the now-defunct White Rabbit, restaurants in Mandarin Oriental and Raffles Hotel, and a husband-and-wife duo. Of this couple, the husband used to make cocktails at Ce La Vi━the rooftop bar at Marina Bay Sands.

These are spread across 6 projects in Tengah, Yishun, Geylang and Kallang/Whampoa.

If you have set your sights this time, you’d probably need no introduction on the new PLH model, but just to recap:

The PLH model will impose additional restrictions, on HDB flats bought in prime areas:

– 10-year MOP instead of five years

– No renting out the whole flat

– Subsidy Recovery, on top of existing resale levy

– Tighter eligibility requirements

– Reduced number of flats set aside for MCPS

This is the first time existing housing estates will have rainwater harvesting facilities, which have been installed in new Build-to-Order (BTO) housing estates since 2018 under the Housing Board's UrbanWater Harvesting System initiative.

HDB estimates that about 15 UrbanWater Harvesting Systems will be installed across 89 blocks in the two towns. The rainwater collected can be used to wash common areas and water plants in the estates, among other non-potable uses.

The 15 systems can potentially save about 17,500 cubic m of water per year, which is equivalent to the average amount of potable water used in more than 85 four-room HDB flats in a year.

Beyond conserving water, rainwater collected by the system can mitigate flash floods at neighbourhoods and estates during a deluge, as it slows down the"

In an interview with TODAY on Friday (March 25), Dr Adrian Loo, group director of wildlife management with NParks, said: ""We didn't want to translocate it because there is a risk that it might come out (to human-populated areas) again.

“The wild boar may have dispersed out (to open urban areas) because it was seeking a new place, or it got chased out by another herd of boars, or it was disorientated, or it was habituated to human food.""

If the boar was moved elsewhere, there may still be a risk of it returning to urban spaces such as roads, which may be a hazard to motorists, vehicular traffic and itself.

“This process of euthanising is usually something of a last resort,” Dr Loo added.
