In May, around 780 three-room and four-room flats are expected to be launched on a site next to Redhill MRT station.
Another 1,660 three-room and four-room units are slated to be offered on a larger site that is bounded by Tiong Bahru and Henderson roads and within walking distance to Tiong Bahru MRT station.
Newer flats in the Redhill and Tiong Bahru areas are mainly on Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers) replacement sites, including City Vue @ Henderson in Henderson Road and Tiong Bahru View in Boon Tiong Road.
On Thursday (Feb 17), HDB launched 3,953 BTO flats, including a second project under the PLH model after the first in Rochor.","flats, bto, bahru, hdb, model, redhill, near, tiong, site, launched, plh, stations, mrt"

The PLH model is aimed at keeping future HDB flats in prime, central locations affordable and inclusive.
This year, the HDB launched more than 17,000 BTO flats and has committed to rolling out the same number, if not more, next year.
This comes amid rising HDB resale flat prices and a longer wait for BTO flats due to construction delays caused by Covid-19.
Property analysts said the Alexandra site will likely attract high demand because of its proximity to Redhill MRT station, the central business district and the Orchard Road shopping belt.","bukit, flats, bto, public, model, hdb, redhill, site, alexandra, housing, walk, built, station, plh, projects, merah, mrt"

The number of new cases in the clusters peaked last Thursday and has since flattened.
