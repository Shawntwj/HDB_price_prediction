# HDB_price_prediction
A data mining project that scrapes and feature engineer HDB variables to use for price prediction. <br>

We aim to investigate the different factors and topics that affect HDB resale prices by applying machine learning techniques to help homeowners understand the common topics that get brought up when discussing housing prices, the sentiment of the different topics, and understand the relationship of various housing features and their importance in predicting housing prices.<br>

The models used for topic modelling are LSA, LDA and BERTopic. The models used for sentiment analysis are VADER, Textblob and Flair. The models used for price predictions are Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Blending.
