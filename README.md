# HDB_price_prediction
A data mining project that scrapes and feature engineer HDB variables to use for price prediction. <br>
We aim to investigate the different factors and topics that affect HDB resale prices by applying machine learning techniques to help homeowners understand the common topics that get brought up when discussing housing prices, the sentiment of the different topics, and understand the relationship of various housing features and their importance in predicting housing prices.<br>
The models used for topic modelling are LSA, LDA and BERTopic. The models used for sentiment analysis are VADER, Textblob, and Flair. The models used for price predictions are Lasso, Random Forest	14
5.3.3. Gradient Boost	14
5.3.4. XGBoost	15
5.3.5. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)	15
5.3.6. Blending



## Motivation

We aim to enable future homeowners to make well-informed decisions when eventually purchasing a flat.<br>
This will be done by extracting the topics from local Singaporean forum Hardwarezone, extracting the sentiments from their posts and lastly predicting housing prices before and after Covid-19.
